Project Overview: Used Car Price Prediction

Objective: Analyze and predict used car prices using a dataset of various car attributes.

Tools: Utilized Python libraries such as pyforest, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

Data: Employed a dataset containing information about used cars, including attributes like brand, model, age, fuel type, and more.

Data Exploration: Explored dataset properties, like columns, data types, and missing values. Derived a new feature, "Used_Car_Age," indicating the age of the car based on the "Year" column. Extracted "Brand" and "Model" information from the "Name" column.

Data Analysis and Visualization: Conducted descriptive statistics and visualizations on numerical features. Explored categorical variables' distribution using bar plots. Visualized correlations between attributes using heatmaps and pair plots.

Data Transformation: Applied logarithmic transformation to features "Kilometers_Driven" and "Price" to mitigate skewness.

Price Analysis: Explored the relationship between different attributes and the log-transformed "Price." Visualized how different attributes like location, transmission, fuel type, brand, and others affect the log-transformed price.

Insights: Derived insights about how various factors such as car age, brand, location, and attributes influence used car prices.

Purpose: The project aimed to understand the used car market and predict prices based on relevant attributes.
